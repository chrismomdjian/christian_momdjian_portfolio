<h2>About this project</h2>
This project is my personal web portfolio. It showcases my most recent projects on the home
page and holds links to things like my github profile, my resume in pdf format, and other projects I'm currently working on.

I frequently update the website to make sure that users that see it's content have an
enjoyable user experience and feel that they can navigate through my portfolio easily
without running into too many issues.

I attempt to resolve issues involving browser incompatibility and screen-responsiveness
to allow users to view the site on any device, whether it be mobile or large screen apple computers.
