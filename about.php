	<p class="text-justify">I love to <strong>code</strong> . I am
  very passionate about building websites and creating something that people can use.
	Nothing feels better to me than learning by doing. Theres something about programming
  and developing that makes me want to know more and more.
  <br><br>
  <strong>I constantly learn.</strong> Right now I'm working on growing my skills in Javascript and front-end development in
  general, however I also have a deep interest in programming with PHP and MySQL to
  interact with databases. PHP is one of my favorite languages. I remember being
  extremely excited when I learned how to make my first contact form with HTML
  forms and PHP. Although I love working with technologies such as PHP and the
  HTML5 stack, I am eager to learn about all things related to tech including
  front-end development, back-end programming, iOS and Android development, as
  well as database patterns and e-commerce.
  <br><br>
  My ultimate goal however, is to become a <strong>great developer</strong> and to
  help clients and businesses achieve their goals.

	<br>
	<p>
  My skills include <strong>HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, PHP &amp; SQL, Python 3+,
  Django, Wordpress, Bootstrap, Git/Github, Slack, Basic SEO best practices</strong>
  and much more!
